                So the reason why I started building this website is that I needed
                a portfolio as a web developer, and I also needed a place to play around
                with up-to-date technologies since I wanted to update my tech stacks as well.
                <br>
                <br>
                At my previous work, I used Laravel and Vue.js, and during the time
                I work for them I wasn't really able to study something else other than the current stack.
                <br>
                <br>
                Now I have more time to study but that wasn't really something
                that I will be satisfied with. I wanted to improve my time
                management skills to achieve more and be more productive so I
                did my research and found this video.

                I was fortunately able to purchase this book from google as an
                E-book. I read it through for a few days, and I realized I had
                been missing so far and why this was happening.
                <br>
                <br>
                The further I looked back how I had been doing, the more I
                realized it, and I wanted to fix it.
                <br>
                <br>
                When I started working on my project I thought it would be
                more enjoyable if I do this somewhat differently. So I decided
                to contact the author of the book.
